# Amazon E-commerce Analysis Project

## Overview
The attached dataset contains ecommerce orders of Amazon from multiple countries in 2023. It is an ecommerce company with a global footprint. In India, the company is headquartered in Hyderabad. The supply chain of the company is very strong. In our dataset, customers are located in 14 countries and they receive orders within a week. The category for which most of these orders were placed is mobile accessories.

There are various ways in which a customer can order. An order can be placed using the companyâ€™s app, its website, using Whatsapp and also via other sources (for example: dialing in the 24*7 support helpline number). Customers are divided into 5 categories: A, B, C, D, E. 

The sales team in the company is structured into 5 teams: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Epsilon. Every team has multiple Sales Managers and a few Sales POCs, typically 3-4. Every sales POC is given individual targets and the sum of the targets of the sales POCs is the target of the Sales Manager.

## Objective
As an analyst, your goal is to help the company derive insights from the data. These insights will help the company take decisions w.r.t. Orders. Eventually it will help the company increase the number of orders, value of orders and hence revenue.
